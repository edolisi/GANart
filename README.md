* **dataset_crop.py** loads jpg images from a folder and crops them into 64-by-64 numpy arrays.

* **dataset_make.py** loads the 64-by-64 cropped images and categorizes them into 13 artistic styles.

* **GAN_64.py** runs DCGAN on the 64-by-64 art dataset; output is keras .h5 files.

* **GAN_64_plot.py** loads a keras .h5 file produced by GAN_64.py and generates fake 64-by-64 art.

* **AE_64.py** runs a simple autoencoder that maps 64-by-64 images into 100-dimensional points.

* **Datasets** folder containing some of the datasets used.

* **Images** folder containing images generated by GAN_64_plot.py.

* **Models** folder containing trained models/weights from GAN_64.py and AE_64.py.
